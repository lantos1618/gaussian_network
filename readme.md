# Gaussian Parameter Fields for Neural Network Tensors

**Abstract:**  
Modern neural networks contain massive parameter sets—millions or billions of weights. Understanding, optimizing, and potentially compressing these parameters is a key challenge. Inspired by techniques from 3D rendering and neural radiance fields, this project experiments with representing neural network weights as a continuous *Gaussian parameter field*. Instead of storing every weight individually, we approximate them with continuous Gaussian functions in a low-dimensional embedding space. This approach, while still early-stage, opens new avenues for interpretability, compression, and potentially improved runtime performance.

**Key Concept:**
- **From Discrete Weights to Continuous Fields:**  
  Traditionally, each weight is a single number. We embed these weights into a low-dimensional space (e.g., 2D or 3D) and assign each an anisotropic Gaussian kernel. Summing these Gaussians forms a continuous density field that approximates the original distribution of weights.
  
- **Potential Benefits:**  
  1. **Interpretability:** Visualizing weights as a continuous density field may reveal structures or clusters not easily seen in raw arrays.
  2. **Compression:** A set of Gaussian kernels could require fewer parameters than a full weight matrix, leading to a form of lossy compression.
  3. **Performance Gains:** Drawing inspiration from Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting’s move toward high-speed rendering, representing weights as fields might allow for faster sampling or specialized hardware acceleration.

**Status:**  
This is a proof-of-concept (MVP). The current code (`gaussian_tensor_test.py`) demonstrates:  
- Extracting weights from a simple neural network layer.  
- Embedding them into a 2D grid as a stand-in for a meaningful embedding.  
- Representing each weight as a Gaussian and splatting them onto a 2D density field.  
- Visualizing the resulting density field.

No optimization of Gaussians or sophisticated embeddings is implemented yet. Future work might include parameter tuning, adaptive refinement, integrating PCA-based embeddings, or experimenting with more complex layers and entire models.

## Environment Setup

Use the provided `environment.yaml` to create a conda environment:


**Create and activate the environment:**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate gaussian_network
```

## Running the Example

Run the proof-of-concept script:
```bash
python gaussian_tensor_test.py
```

You should see a matplotlib window with a 2D visualization of the density field. The script:
- Creates a small linear layer and extracts weights.
- Embeds them on a 2D grid.
- Sums their Gaussian contributions over a discretized domain.
- Displays the resulting density.

## Roadmap and Future Work

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use PCA or other embeddings to map weights into a meaningful space where clusters correspond to interesting features.
- **Adaptive Gaussian Optimization:** Instead of fixed Gaussians, optimize means, covariances, and intensities to minimize some reconstruction error of the original weights.
- **Performance Studies:** Investigate if this representation can lead to speed improvements by sampling weights on-demand or leveraging GPU-accelerated continuous sampling.
- **Extended Interpretability:** Correlate patterns in the Gaussian field with training stages, generalization performance, or model architectures.
